# OPER617_Networks_Project
OPER 617 class from AFIT Quarter 3

Final Project was trying to create a model in LINGO that would optimize a travelling salesman problem of:
  Going to every baseball stadium in the shortest amount of time while seeing a game
  
The LINGO code was made well (checked by teacher) but the model was too big to solve, so no answer other than a heuristic was solved.
